# Downhill-Simplex

A Python project that performs a downhill simplex to optimize a function defined over n variables. The number of inputs of the function must be greater than one and the function can only have on output. 

This implementation works on functions with a theoretical minimum. 

This implementation was written for functions that have a large cost to evaluate the function so evaluations are kept to a minimum and the run-time will be determined by the cost of evaluating.
